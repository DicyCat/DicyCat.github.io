## General
> We are a group of students attending the University of York attending (some form of) Computer Science! This is our [GitHub](https://github.com/Luceapuce/SEPR-project) pages for the [SEPR module](https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/COM00008I/2019-20) where we have to create a game where aliens invade York!
